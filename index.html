        subject: "Humble Request to Recommend 01.01.2025 as Age Cut-off for SSC CGL - Ref: Corr. No. 2792565, Dated 20.06.2025",
        body: `Respected Sir,\n\nThis is with reference to our representation dated 20 June 2025, submitted to the Secretary, DoPT and officially acknowledged under Correspondence Computer No. 2792565. We have been informed that the matter has been entrusted to you for examination and report.\n\nOn behalf of thousands of aspirants, we humbly request you to kindly recommend 01.01.2025 as the age reckoning date for SSC CGL 2025. For many of us, this is our final attempt, and CGL is the only exam we are eligible and thoroughly prepared for over years.\n\nThe representation detailed several serious irregularities in CGL 2024, 22 wrong questions, inclusion of overaged JSO candidates, delayed result corrections, and Tier-II admit cards issued just a day before the exam. Aspirants lost their final opportunity not due to performance, but due to systemic failure. Several court cases are ongoing, and even the Hon'ble CAT acknowledged it as an \"unlevel playing field.\"\n\nThe last date to apply for CGL 2025 is 4 July 2025. If action is not taken urgently, thousands of aspirants will be left behind unfairly.\n\nDoPT granted similar relief in CGL 2015 and 2016, and your own OM dated 14.07.1988 (Para 16.2) supports this request, especially when the system itself has failed its candidates.\n\nSir, your timely recommendation to the Secretary can ensure justice and dignity for those with no other door left. We sincerely hope you will support this just cause before the deadline expires.\n\nSincerely,\nConcerned SSC CGL 2024 Aspirants\nContact: 8219239139`
